# Blueprint: Techmall E-Commerce Platform

## 1. Overview
This project is a full-stack Laravel e-commerce application. The goal is to create a visually stunning, modern, and high-converting online store with a clean and light aesthetic, designed to be developed within the Firebase Studio environment.

## 2. Style and Design
*   **Theme:** Light, modern, and clean.
*   **Primary Colors:** White or off-white backgrounds.
*   **Accent Colors:** A modern and vibrant color palette for calls-to-action.
*   **Background:** Clean and simple.

## 4. SEO Improvements
*   **Heading Structure:** Updated the heading structure on all pages to ensure each page has a single `<h1>` tag and a logical heading hierarchy for improved SEO. This was implemented in the following files:
    *   `resources/views/welcome.blade.php`
    *   `resources/views/contact.blade.php`
    *   `resources/views/auth/login.blade.php`

    *   `resources/views/auth/passwords/reset.blade.php`
    *   `resources/views/auth/passwords/confirm.blade.php`
    *   `resources/views/auth/verify.blade.php`

## 5. Link Updates
*   **Header and Footer Links:** Updated all menu and footer links to ensure that every link directs to the correct page.

## 6. Categories Dropdown
*   **Categories Dropdown:** Added a "Categories" dropdown menu to the main navigation, ahead of the "Shop" link.
*   **Dynamic Category Links:** The dropdown is populated with all available categories, and each category links to its own dedicated page.

## 7. Current Plan: Light Theme Conversion and Product Page

*   **Step 1: Theme Conversion to Light Mode**
    *   Update the color scheme of the entire website to a light and clean aesthetic.
    *   Adjust primary and accent colors to complement the new light theme.

*   **Step 2: Product Seeding**
    *   Add new products to the store, including Apple and Samsung chargers, and wireless earbuds.

*   **Step 3: Product Detail Page**
    *   Create a new view for the product detail page.
    *   Include a product image gallery, product name, description, price, and quantity selector.
    *   Add "Add to Cart," "Buy Now," and "Checkout" buttons.
