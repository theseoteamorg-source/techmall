## 3. Current Task: Fix Application Errors and Merge Conflicts

The application was experiencing a series of critical errors and merge conflicts that prevented it from running correctly and left the user interface in an unprofessional state. The following steps were taken to identify and resolve these issues:

1.  **Resolved `Undefined array key "id"` Error:** The initial error was caused by an incorrect variable name in the `CartController.php` file. This was fixed by changing `$request->product_id` to `$request->id`.

2.  **Resolved `Call to a member function getFormattedPrice() on null` Error:** This error occurred because the `Product` model did not have a `getFormattedPrice()` method. This was resolved by adding a `getFormattedPriceAttribute` accessor to the `Product` model.

3.  **Resolved `Call to undefined method Darryldecode\Cart\Cart::instance()` Error:** This error indicated an incorrect usage of the cart library. The code was updated to use the session-based cart implementation provided by the `CartController.php`.

4.  **Resolved `syntax error, unexpected token "<<"` Error:** A git merge conflict in the `app/Models/Product.php` file caused a fatal syntax error. The conflict was resolved by manually merging the code and removing the conflict markers.

5.  **Resolved `Route [shop.home] not defined` Error:** The route name `shop.home` was incorrectly used in multiple files, including the header, footer, and product page. The correct route name, `home`, was applied to all affected files.

6.  **Resolved Merge Conflicts in Views:**  The `product.blade.php`, `footer.blade.php` and `frontend.blade.php` files all contained merge conflicts that were visible in the user interface. These conflicts were resolved by manually merging the code and removing the conflict markers.

All of these issues have been resolved, and the application is now stable, running correctly, and free of any visible errors or merge conflicts.
