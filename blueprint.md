# Blueprint: Techmall E-Commerce Platform

## 1. Overview
This project is a full-stack Laravel e-commerce application. The goal is to create a visually stunning, modern, and high-converting online store with a clean and light aesthetic, designed to be developed within the Firebase Studio environment.

## 2. Style and Design
*   **Theme:** Light, modern, and clean.
*   **Primary Colors:** White or off-white backgrounds.
*   **Accent Colors:** A modern and vibrant color palette for calls-to-action.
*   **Background:** Clean and simple.
*   **Typography:** Clean, modern sans-serif font.
*   **Effects:** Subtle shadows and clean lines.

## 3. Implemented Features
*   Full e-commerce storefront.
*   User authentication.
*   Shopping cart functionality.
*   Product and category displays.
*   Fully responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
*   Modern, sophisticated header and footer.
*   Animated and stylish product cards.

## 4. SEO Improvements
*   **Heading Structure:** Updated the heading structure on all pages to ensure each page has a single `<h1>` tag and a logical heading hierarchy for improved SEO. This was implemented in the following files:
    *   `resources/views/welcome.blade.php`
    *   `resources/views/contact.blade.php`
    *   `resources/views/auth/login.blade.php`
    *   `resources/views/auth/register.blade.php`
    *   `resources/views/auth/passwords/email.blade.php`
    *   `resources/views/auth/passwords/reset.blade.php`
    *   `resources/views/auth/passwords/confirm.blade.php`
    *   `resources/views/auth/verify.blade.php`

## 5. Link Updates
*   **Header and Footer Links:** Updated all menu and footer links to ensure that every link directs to the correct page.

## 6. Categories Dropdown
*   **Categories Dropdown:** Added a "Categories" dropdown menu to the main navigation, ahead of the "Shop" link.
*   **Dynamic Category Links:** The dropdown is populated with all available categories, and each category links to its own dedicated page.

## 7. Admin Panel
*   **Admin Dashboard:** Created a new admin dashboard accessible at `/admin/dashboard`.
*   **Admin Middleware:** Implemented an `AdminMiddleware` to ensure that only authenticated admin users can access the admin panel.
*   **User Model:** The `User` model now includes an `is_admin` boolean attribute to distinguish admin users.
*   **Admin Layout:** A dedicated layout has been created for the admin panel, including a header, footer, and sidebar for navigation.

## 8. Admin Routes
*   **Comprehensive Routes:** The `routes/admin.php` file has been updated to include routes for all existing admin controllers:
    *   `BrandController`
    *   `CategoryController`
    *   `DashboardController`
    *   `ProductController`
    *   `SettingController`
    *   `UserController`
    *   `OrderController`
    *   `CustomerController`
    *   `RedirectController`

## 9. Controller Consolidation
*   **Settings Controller:** Merged the functionality of `SettingsController` into `SettingController` and deleted the redundant `SettingsController.php` file. All settings-related logic is now handled by `SettingController`.

## 10. Current Plan: Admin Panel Development
*   With the admin panel foundation in place, the next steps will involve building out the functionality for each of the admin sections.
