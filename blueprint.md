# Project Blueprint: Feature-Rich E-commerce Platform

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the plan for building a modern, feature-rich e-commerce platform using the Laravel framework. The goal is to create a scalable, secure, and user-friendly online store with a comprehensive set of features for both customers and administrators.

## 2. Style and Design

The application will feature a modern and clean design, with a focus on user experience and accessibility. The following design principles will be applied:

*   **Responsive Design:** The layout will be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices (desktops, tablets, and smartphones).
*   **Minimalist Aesthetic:** The design will be clean and uncluttered, with a focus on product presentation.
*   **Intuitive Navigation:** The user interface will be easy to navigate, with a clear and logical structure.
*   **High-Quality Visuals:** The platform will use high-quality product images and a visually appealing color scheme.
*   **Typography:** We will use a clean and readable font pairing, with a clear hierarchy for headings and body text.
*   **Interactivity:** The application will incorporate subtle animations and transitions to enhance the user experience.

## 3. Implemented Features

*   **Database Schema:**
    *   Created migrations for `products`, `categories`, `brands`, `product_variants`, `orders`, `order_items`, `users`, and several other related tables.
    *   Optimized database schema with appropriate data types, indexes, and foreign key constraints.
*   **Product Management:**
    *   Created `Product` model with `SoftDeletes` and fillable attributes.
    *   Created a resourceful `ProductController` for handling CRUD operations.
    *   Developed Blade views for creating, reading, updating, and deleting products (`index`, `create`, `edit`).
