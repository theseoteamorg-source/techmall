# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a full-stack e-commerce application built with Laravel. It includes features like product browsing, a shopping cart, user authentication, and an admin panel for managing products and users. The application is designed to be a modern, robust, and scalable e-commerce platform.

## Implemented Features

### Core Features

*   **User Authentication:** Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
*   **Product Catalog:** Products are organized by categories and brands.
*   **Shopping Cart:** Users can add products to their cart and proceed to checkout.
*   **Admin Panel:** An admin panel for managing products, categories, brands, and users.

### Design and Styling

*   **Frontend:** The frontend is built with Blade templates and styled with Bootstrap.
*   **Layout:** A consistent layout is maintained across the application using a master layout file.
*   **Responsive Design:** The application is designed to be responsive and work on different screen sizes.

### Review and Rating System
*   **Database Schema:** A `reviews` table has been added to the database to store product reviews. The table includes columns for `user_id`, `product_id`, `rating`, and `comment`.
*   **Models:**
    *   A `Review` model has been created to represent a product review.
    *   The `Product` model has a `hasMany` relationship with the `Review` model.
    *   The `User` model has a `hasMany` relationship with the `Review` model.
*   **Database Seeding:** A `ReviewSeeder` has been created to populate the `reviews` table with sample data.
*   **Product Detail Page:**
    *   The product detail page now displays the average rating and the total number of reviews for each product.
    *   A "Reviews" tab has been added to the product detail page, which displays all the reviews for the product.
    *   Each review shows the user's name, the rating they gave, their comment, and the date the review was submitted.
*   **Review Submission:**
    *   A form has been added to the product detail page to allow authenticated users to submit a new review.
    *   The form includes a star rating system and a comment box.
    *   A `ReviewController` has been created to handle the submission of new reviews.
    *   A new route has been added to `routes/web.php` to handle the review submission.
